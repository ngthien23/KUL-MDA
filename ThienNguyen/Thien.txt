TODO:
what to do with missing data?
Dummy code buildings, add to regression
Use noise event


DONE:
group average by month day hour
dummy code for green (by looking at map)
combine weather + noise locations with noise inside weather
combine 4 files + [month date hour rainin temp_qc3] !NA
fit glm: weekend + rain + temp + hour (sin-cos) = noise level

FAILED:
combine weather+noise with coordinates, by:
	assign coordinates to weather
	assign noise-s to weather (based on distance -> how far?)
	take average assigned noise-s
